			"description": " Scenarios are small, contained mission maps. Usually one mission per map. The scripts created by the BeamNG.drive team can be found via the BeamNG.drive icon in the corner of the map. The scenarios are also divided according to their complexity, from the simplest to the most difficult. Can you drive to a gas station without fuel? Or gently descend a steep cliff? Everything depends on you and your abilities. We recommend starting with the simplest of scenario difficulties. In doing so, you will get acquainted with the game and master the control of the car. As you move from simple to complex scenarios, you will improve, and many of them will make you motivate you to clear them as accurately and quickly as possible. "

			"description": "In this mode, you can feel like a bus driver! But don’t underestimate this, as some routes can be quite complex. For example, you might be tasked with taking loads of sharp angles that busses wouldn’t normally take. You can also balance and maneuver along short streets or steep slopes. This is a great way to take on a vehicle that feels very different in how it drives"
